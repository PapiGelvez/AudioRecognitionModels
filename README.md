# Audio recognition models

This project has all the files related to the preprocessing, dataset handling and deep learning files for the creation of two audio classification models: MLP and CNN.

Each .py has a short description at the beginning that explains its purpose.

Before running any file, make sure to have downloaded the original dataset.

This project uses the Latin-American voice anti-spoofing dataset created by:
